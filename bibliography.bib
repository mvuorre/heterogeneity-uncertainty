  abstract = {Effect sizes are an important outcome of quantitative research, but few guidelines exist that explain how researchers can determine which effect sizes are meaningful. Psychologists often want to study effects that are large enough to make a difference to people's subjective experience. Thus, subjective experience is one way to gauge the meaningfulness of an effect. We propose and illustrate one method for how to quantify the smallest subjectively experienced difference\textemdash the smallest change in an outcome measure that individuals consider to be meaningful enough in their subjective experience such that they are willing to rate themselves as feeling different\textemdash using an anchor-based method with a global rating of change question applied to the positive and negative affect scale. We provide a step-by-step guide for the questions that researchers need to consider in deciding whether and how to use the anchor-based method, and we make explicit the assumptions of the method that future research can examine. For researchers interested in people's subjective experiences, this anchor-based method provides one way to specify a smallest effect size of interest, which allows researchers to interpret observed results in terms of their theoretical and practical significance.},

  abstract = {All experimenters know that human and animal subjects do not respond uniformly to experimental treatments. Yet theories and findings in experimental psychology either ignore this causal effect heterogeneity or treat it as uninteresting error. This is the case even when data are available to examine effect heterogeneity directly, in within-subjects designs where experimental effects can be examined subject by subject. Using data from four repeated-measures experiments, we show that effect heterogeneity can be modeled readily, that its discovery presents exciting opportunities for theory and methods, and that allowing for it in study designs is good research practice. This evidence suggests that experimenters should work from the assumption that causal effects are heterogeneous. Such a working assumption will be of particular benefit, given the increasing diversity of subject populations in psychology.},

  abstract = {Individuals differ not only in background characteristics, often called ``pretreatment heterogeneity,'' but also in how they respond to a particular treatment, event, or intervention. A principal interaction of interest for questions of selection into treatment and causal inference in the social sciences is between the treatment and the propensity of treatment. Although the importance of ``treatment-effect heterogeneity,'' so defined, has been widely recognized in the causal inference literature, empirical quantitative social science research has not fully absorbed these lessons. In this chapter, we describe key estimation strategies for the study of heterogeneous treatment effects; we discuss recent research that attends to causal effect heterogeneity, with a focus on the study of effects of education, and what we gain from such attention; and we demonstrate the methods with an example of the effects of college on civic participation. The primary goal of this chapter is to encourage researchers to routinely examine treatment-effect heterogeneity with the same rigor they devote to pretreatment heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Memory scientists usually compare mean performance on some measure(s) (accuracy, confidence, latency) as a function of experimental condition. Some researchers have made within-subject variability in task performance a focal outcome measure (e.g., Yao et al., Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 38, 227--237, 2016). Here, we explored between-subject variability in accuracy as a function of experimental conditions. This work was inspired by an incidental finding in a previous study, in which we observed greater variability in accuracy of memory performance on cued recall (CR) versus free recall (FR) of English animal/object nouns (Mah et al., Frontiers in Psychology, 14, 1146200, 2023). Here we report experiments designed to assess the reliability of that pattern and to explore its causes (e.g., differential interpretation of instructions, [un]relatedness of CR word pairs, encoding time). In Experiment 1 (N = 120 undergraduates), we replicated the CR:FR variability difference with a more representative set of English nouns. In Experiments 2A (N = 117 Prolific participants) and 2B (N = 127 undergraduates), we found that the CR:FR variability difference persisted in a forced-recall procedure. In Experiment 3 (N = 260 Prolific participants), we used meaningfully related word pairs and still found greater variability in CR than in FR performance. In Experiment 4 (N = 360 Prolific participants), we equated CR and FR study phases by having all participants study pairs and, again, observed greater variability in CR than FR. The same was true in Experiment 5 (N = 120 undergraduates), in which study time was self-paced. Comparisons of variability across subjects can yield insights into the mechanisms underlying task performance.},

  abstract = {The ways in which individuals think and feel about themselves play a significant role in guiding behavior across many domains in life. The current studies investigate how individuals may shift the positivity of self-evaluations in order to sustain their chronic or momentary motivational concerns. Specifically, we propose that more positive self-evaluations support eagerness that sustains promotion-focused concerns with advancement, whereas less positive self-evaluations support vigilance that sustains prevention-focused concerns with safety. The current studies provide evidence that self-evaluation inflation is associated with promotion concerns whereas self-evaluation deflation is associated with prevention concerns, whether regulatory focus is situationally manipulated (Studies 1, 2b, and 3) or measured as a chronic individual difference (Study 2a). Following regulatory focus primes, individuals in a promotion focus showed relatively greater accessibility of positive versus negative self-knowledge compared to individuals in a prevention focus (Study 1). In an ongoing performance situation, participants in a promotion focus reported higher self-esteem than participants in a prevention focus (Studies 2a and 2b). Finally, individuals in a promotion focus persisted longer on an anagram task when given an opportunity to focus on their strengths versus weaknesses, which was not the case for individuals in a prevention focus (Study 3). Across studies, the predicted interactions were consistently obtained, although sometimes the effects were stronger for promotion or prevention motivation. We discuss implications for existing models of the motives underlying self-evaluation.},

Here we develop a set of nested models that account for order restrictions across individuals in psychological tasks. An order-restricted model addresses the question ``Does everybody,'' as in ``Does everybody show the usual Stroop effect,'' or ``Does everybody respond more quickly to intense noises than subtle ones?'' The crux of the modeling is the instantiation of 10s or 100s of order restrictions simultaneously, one for each participant. To our knowledge, the problem is intractable in frequentist contexts but relatively straightforward in Bayesian ones. We develop a Bayes factor model-comparison strategy using Zellner and Siow's default g-priors appropriate for assessing whether effects obey equality and order restrictions. We apply the methodology to seven data sets from Stroop, Simon, and Eriksen interference tasks. Not too surprisingly, we find that everybody Stroops\textemdash that is, for all people congruent colors are truly named more quickly than incongruent ones. But, perhaps surprisingly, we find these order constraints are violated for some people in the Simon task, that is, for these people spatially incongruent responses occur truly more quickly than congruent ones! Implications of the modeling and conjectures about the task-related differences are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

In a Stroop task, for example, the true average effect may be 50 ms with a standard deviation of say 30 ms. In this case, some individuals will have greater effects than 50 ms, some will have smaller, and some are forecasted to have negative effects in sign\textemdash they respond faster to incongruent items than to congruent ones! But are there people who have a true negative effect in Stroop or any other task? We highlight three qualitatively different effects: negative effects, null effects, and positive effects. The main goal of this paper is to develop models that allow researchers to explore whether all three are present in a task: Do all individuals show a positive effect? Are there individuals with truly no effect? Are there any individuals with negative effects? We develop a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that capture a variety of these constraints. We apply this approach to Stroop interference experiments and a near-liminal priming experiment where the prime may be below and above threshold for different people. We show that most tasks people are quite alike\textemdash for example everyone has positive Stroop effects and nobody fails to Stroop or Stroops negatively.

We explain a range of approaches to determine the SESOI in psychological science and provide detailed examples of how equivalence tests should be performed and reported.

  abstract = {Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process. In a preregistered study we collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed by Persi Diaconis. The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started -- Diaconis estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51\%. Our data lend strong support to this precise prediction: the coins landed on the same side more often than not, \$\textbackslash text\{Pr\}(\textbackslash text\{same side\}) = 0.508\$, 95\% credible interval (CI) [\$0.506\$, \$0.509\$], \$\textbackslash text\{BF\}\_\{\textbackslash text\{same-side bias\}\} = 2364\$. Furthermore, the data revealed considerable between-people variation in the degree of this same-side bias. Our data also confirmed the generic prediction that when people flip an ordinary coin -- with the initial side-up randomly determined -- it is equally likely to land heads or tails: \$\textbackslash text\{Pr\}(\textbackslash text\{heads\}) = 0.500\$, 95\% CI [\$0.498\$, \$0.502\$], \$\textbackslash text\{BF\}\_\{\textbackslash text\{heads-tails bias\}\} = 0.183\$. Furthermore, this lack of heads-tails bias does not appear to vary across coins. Our data therefore provide strong evidence that when some (but not all) people flip a fair coin, it tends to land on the same side it started. Our data provide compelling statistical support for Diaconis' physics model of coin tossing.},

  abstract = {The question whether social media use benefits or undermines adolescents' well-being is an important societal concern. Previous empirical studies have mostly established across-the-board effects among (sub)populations of adolescents. As a result, it is still an open question whether the effects are unique for each individual adolescent. We sampled adolescents' experiences six times per day for one week to quantify differences in their susceptibility to the effects of social media on their momentary affective well-being. Rigorous analyses of 2,155 real-time assessments showed that the association between social media use and affective well-being differs strongly across adolescents: While 44\% did not feel better or worse after passive social media use, 46\% felt better, and 10\% felt worse. Our results imply that person-specific effects can no longer be ignored in research, as well as in prevention and intervention programs.},

  abstract = {The study of social media effects on psychological well-being has reached an impasse: Popular commentators confidently assert that social media are bad for users but research results are mixed and have had little practical impact. In response, one research group has proposed a path forward for the field that moves beyond studying population averages to find effects that are specific to individuals. Here, we outline three objections to that research agenda. On a methodological level, the key empirical results of this programme\textemdash proportions of the population of individuals with negative, null, and positive social media effects\textemdash are not appropriately estimated and reported. On a theoretical level, these results do little to advance our understanding of social media and its psychological implications. On a paradigmatic level, this ``personalized media effects paradigm'' (Valkenburg et al., 2021a, p. 74) cannot inform inferences about individuals and therefore does not deliver what it claims. In this work we express our concern that this research approach may be contributing to confusing messaging to both societal stakeholders and scientists investigating how social media and well- being might be related. It is our sincere hope that describing these objections directly will prompt the field to work together in adopting better practices to ultimately develop a better understanding of well-being in the digital age.},

Their content expands the coverage of the book to include models for discrete level-1 outcomes, non-nested level-2 units, incomplete data, and measurement error--all vital topics in contemporary social statistics. In the tradition of the first edition, they are clearly written and make good use of interesting substantive examples to illustrate the methods. Advanced graduate students and social researchers will find the expanded edition immediately useful and pertinent to their research." --TED GERBER, Sociology, University of Arizona "Chapter 11 was also exciting reading and shows the versatility of the mixed model with the EM algorithm. There was a new revelation on practically every page. I found the exposition to be extremely clear. It was like being led from one treasure room to another, and all of the gems are inherently useful. These are problems that researchers face everyday, and this chapter gives us an excellent alternative to how we have traditionally handled these problems." --PAUL SWANK, Houston School of Nursing, University of Texas, Houston Popular in the First Edition for its rich, illustrative examples and lucid explanations of the theory and use of hierarchical linear models (HLM), the book has been reorganized into four parts with four completely new chapters. The first two parts, Part I on "The Logic of Hierarchical Linear Modeling" and Part II on "Basic Applications" closely parallel the first nine chapters of the previous edition with significant expansions and technical clarifications, such as: * An intuitive introductory summary of the basic procedures for estimation and inference used with HLM models that only requires a minimal level of mathematical sophistication in Chapter 3 * New section on multivariate growth models in Chapter 6 * A discussion of research synthesis or meta-analysis applications in Chapter 7 * Data analytic advice on centering of level-1 predictors and new material on plausible value intervals and robust standard estimators While the first edition confined its attention to continuously distributed outcomes at level 1, this second edition now includes coverage of an array of outcomes types in Part III: * New Chapter 10 considers applications of hierarchical models in the case of binary outcomes, counted data, ordered categories, and multinomial outcomes using detailed examples to illustrate each case * New Chapter 11 on latent variable models, including estimating regressions from missing data, estimating regressions when predictors are measured with error, and embedding item response models within the framework of the HLM model * New introduction to the logic of Bayesian inference with applications to hierarchical data (Chapter 13) The authors conclude in Part IV with the statistical theory and computations used throughout the book, including univariate models with normal level-1 errors, multivariate linear models, and hierarchical generalized linear models.},

DSEM is suitable for analyzing intensive longitudinal data where observations from multiple individuals are collected at many points in time. The modeling framework encompasses previously published DSEM models and is a comprehensive attempt to combine timeseries modeling with structural equation modeling. DSEM is estimated with Bayesian methods using the Markov chain Monte Carlo Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis\textendash Hastings sampler. We provide a detailed description of the estimation algorithm as implemented in the Mplus software package. DSEM can be used for longitudinal analysis of any duration and with any number of observations across time. Simulation studies are used to illustrate the framework and study the performance of the estimation method. Methods for evaluating model fit are also discussed.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a new approach to factor analysis and structural equation modeling using Bayesian analysis. The new approach replaces parameter specifications of exact zeros with approximate zeros based on informative, small-variance priors. It is argued that this produces an analysis that better reflects substantive theories. The proposed Bayesian approach is particularly beneficial in applications where parameters are added to a conventional model such that a nonidentified model is obtained if maximumlikelihood estimation is applied. This approach is useful for measurement aspects of latent variable modeling, such as with confirmatory factor analysis, and the measurement part of structural equation modeling. Two application areas are studied, cross-loadings and residual correlations in confirmatory factor analysis. An example using a full structural equation model is also presented, showing an efficient way to find model misspecification. The approach encompasses 3 elements: model testing using posterior predictive checking, model estimation, and model modification. Monte Carlo simulations and real data are analyzed using Mplus. The real-data analyses use data from Holzinger and Swineford's (1939) classic mental abilities study, Big Five personality factor data from a British survey, and science achievement data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988.},

In this case study, we examined 162,325 intensive longitudinal in-game mood reports from 67,328 play sessions of 8,695 players of the popular game PowerWash Simulator. We compared players' moods at the beginning of play session with their moods during play, and found that the average player reported 0.034 [0.032, 0.036] visual analog scale (VAS; 0-1) units greater mood during than at the beginning of play sessions. Moreover, we predict that 72.1\% [70.8\%, 73.5\%] of similar players experience this afective uplift during play, and that the bulk of it happens during the irst 15 minutes of play. We do not know whether these results indicate causal efects or to what extent they generalize to other games or player populations. Yet, these results based on in-game subjective reports from players of a popular commercially available game suggest good external validity, and as such ofer a promising glimpse of the scientific value of transparent industry-academia collaborations in understanding the psychological roles of popular digital entertainment.

For many researchers, an additional, important question is, ``How many people in my study behaved or responded in a manner consistent with theoretical expectation?'' We show how the answer to this question can be computed and reported as a straightforward percentage for a wide variety of study designs. This percentage essentially treats persons as an effect size, and it can easily be understood by scientists, professionals, and laypersons alike. For instance, imagine that in addition to d or {$\eta$}2, a researcher reports that 80\% of participants matched theoretical expectation. No statistical training is required to understand the basic meaning of this percentage. By analyzing recently published studies, we show how computing this percentage can reveal novel patterns within data that provide insights for extending and developing the theory under investigation.},
